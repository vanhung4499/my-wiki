Record the process of building this site, and share some thoughts and experiences.

## Introduction

This is my personal blog and my personal wiki. I record some of my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge in the process of learning and working. I hope to share my knowledge with more people and learn from each other.

## Features

Please refer to the [Wiki](wiki) for details on the features of this site.

I write a lot of articles about technical: programming, algorithms, databases, frameworks, DevOps, side projects, system design, design-pattern, and interviews.

## How to build

I build this site using [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org). The theme is [Hope](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press).

I love markdown! I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to write and manage my articles by markdown.

Please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/vanhung4499/my-wiki) for more details on how to build this site.

## Deploy

This site is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by [GitHub Actions].
