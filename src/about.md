## Introduction

My previous wiki was built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), which is a publish tool for obsidian nots. I have been using it for a long time, but I found that it is not very convenient to share and search because of the navigation and the structure of the page. So I need to find a better alternative.

After some searching on github, I found some good-looking wiki/blog sites. I tried some of them then the last choice of me is [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/zh/), which is a static site generator based on Vue.js. It is very easy to use and has a lot of plugins and themes. I chose the [vuepress-theme-hope](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/zh/) theme, which is very beautiful and has a lot of features.

And I found a customized of hope theme, which is [https://github.com/OrageKK/oragekk.github.io](https://github.com/OrageKK/oragekk.github.io), It is very beautiful and has a lot of features. So I forked it and made some changes to fit my needs. Thanks to the author for the great work.

## Markdown Enhancement

The Markdown effect of the hope theme is surprisingly good, and it supports many features that ordinary Markdown does not, such as custom containers, code blocks with tabs, and the most convenient feature of being able to write flowcharts directly. It also allows for optional highlight themes (the code highlighting on this site is based on shikiPlugin, which, although not as lightweight and efficient as the default prismjs, provides more accurate syntax highlighting). For specific effects, see here â˜ž [Markdown Enhance](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/guide/markdown/intro.html).

## Framework Support

[vuepress2.x](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/)

## Theme Support

[vuepress-theme-hope](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/)

## Markdown Editor

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to write markdown files, which is a very powerful markdown editor. It supports many features such as graph view, backlinks, and plugins. I highly recommend it.

To work along with VuePress, you only need create a new vault in `src` folder, and then you can write markdown files in it.

::: tip
When you create a new vault, an `.obsidian` will be created in the `src` directory, this is Obsidian configs and plugins folder. You can ignore it in the `.gitignore` file to avoid uploading it to the repository.

   - `vuepress-plugin-live2DAssist` (assistant for Live2D; hides on pages with sidebars to avoid obstruction)
